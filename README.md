# JS Back-End

## Course Info

The intensive course aims to teach how to develop server-side JavaScript applications on the Node.js platform using Express.js as a framework. It covers building a server with Node.js, the server-client relationship, and creating fast data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, using the latest concepts and tools. The course will also cover the MongoDB database, which is a popular non-relational database, and the Mongoose library for data retrieval. Additionally, a complete REST API will be built using Express.js and MongoDB towards the end of the course.

## Skills

- Creating an MVC architecture
- Application development with Express and Handlebars,
- Non-relational databases
- Working with server applications with Node.js
- Working with the HTTP protocol
- Using a Web Server

# JS Applications

## Course Info

During the JS Applications course, students learn what HTTP Requests are and how to use them. They will acquire knowledge of REST Services, understand Baas (backend as a service) and its usage, comprehend the concept of asynchronous code (such as promises, async, or await), and comprehend the concepts of templating and routing. Students will understand the architecture of an application and how to properly structure it. By the end of the course, they will have explored different design patterns and their practical guidelines, created their web components, used the Web Components standard, and built a Webpack environment from scratch.
The course required creating a single-page application using the techniques learned from previous lectures. They will be assessed on this application.

## Skills

- What is HTTP and how to make requests
- Creating simple single-page applications
- Working with templates and routing
- Working with non-relational databases
- Working with REST APIs and asynchronous programming
- Testing the application

# Programming Advanced with JavaScript

## Course Info

In the 'JS Advanced' course, students get in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes, and writing functions. They will study more complex concepts like function context, explicit binding, and event loop. The course will develop their algorithmic thinking. After successful completion of this course, students will be able to work with the DOM tree, do manipulations on it, and work with 'events'. Functional and OOP approaches to JavaScript programming will be explored, studying concepts such as inheritance, object composition, and prototype chaining.

## Skills

- Working with classes and objects
- Working with functions and JSON formats
- Information extraction and manipulation of the DOM tree
- Working with linear structures
- Object-oriented programming
- Functional programming

# Programming Fundamentals with JavaScript

## Course Info

With 'Programming Fundamentals', students begin to study SoftUni's in-house program for the comprehensive training of software engineers. The course examines fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis for effective and quality training in the professional modules. Learners build on the knowledge gained in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more complex programming concepts and structures such as arrays, sheets, objects, and classes.

Additional technologies that are essential for every software developer are thoroughly examined, including HTML and CSS, HTTP, bitwise operations, and other related technologies. The course effectively outlines the fundamentals of web development as well as one of the most prevalent technologies and tools. This approach effectively elucidates the forthcoming professional modules and the knowledge that will be acquired from them to become proficient software developers.

## Skills

- Handling the standard functionality of the programming language
- Basics of web development
- Understanding the interrelationship between different IT concepts
- Analysis of complex problems and reduction to computer-executable steps
- Basic HTML and CSS skills
- Working with linear data structures
