                        Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions.
                        Small minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a
                        feeling that you can become great too.

                        Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of
                        self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the
                        best of which you are capable.

                        Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision.
                        The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward
                        organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common
                        people to attain uncommon results. Individual commitment to a
                        group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company work, a
                        society work, a civilization work.
